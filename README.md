## 🎋 Intro: <br>
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe with an AI on 10x10 board. It is a project for my course. The code is a mix of C programming, game logic, and AI decision-making algorithms, with a focus on system-level programming and memory management.

## 📦 Tech Stack:  <br>
Libraries mostly created by me and my mate, program is using some standard C libraries like: string.h, stdio.h, assert.h, malloc.h, stdbool.h. Implementation of negamax and data structures like: structs and enums and memoru management. 

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Features:  <br>
The game is not fully automated, meaning that every time you want to make your/AI move you need to write a command. Commands are in polish, as this language was comfortable for us. It features player/AI moves and reseting board.

## 💭 Process:  <br>
I had a blast writing this. Sometimes my brain stopped working while figuring out negamax and score system, but other than that it was fun.

## 📚 Learnings:  <br>
I have got the gist of dynamic memeory allocation, function pointers, structures and enumerations.

## ✨ Improvement:  <br>
The code could definitely be improved. Mostly negamax, because on higher depth of calculating moves it's very slow. The rest I think works just fine.

## 🚦 Running the Project:  <br>
1. Clone Repository
2. Run Makefile
3. Have fun!
